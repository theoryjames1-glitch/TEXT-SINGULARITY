# TEXT-SINGULARITY

Got it 👍 — here’s a **list of common text similarity metrics** you can use to evaluate generated text vs. target text. I’ll group them into **string-based**, **embedding-based**, and **learned/reward-model-based** approaches.

---

# 🔹 1. String-based (lexical overlap)

Operate directly on tokens/characters.

* **BLEU** → counts n-gram overlap between generated & reference text.
* **ROUGE (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L)** → recall-oriented, measures overlap of unigrams, bigrams, and longest common subsequence.
* **METEOR** → considers precision, recall, and synonym matches (via WordNet).
* **TER (Translation Edit Rate)** → number of edits needed to transform hypothesis → reference.
* **ChrF / ChrF++** → character n-gram F-scores, good for morphologically rich languages.
* **WER (Word Error Rate)** → edit distance at word level, used in speech recognition.

✅ Pros: Simple, explainable.
❌ Cons: Too rigid, doesn’t capture meaning well.

---

# 🔹 2. Embedding-based (semantic similarity)

Use vector representations of sentences or tokens.

* **Cosine similarity** → between embeddings (e.g. sentence embeddings).
* **Euclidean / Manhattan distance** → on embedding vectors.
* **BERTScore** → uses contextual embeddings (BERT, RoBERTa) to align tokens between candidate & reference.
* **MoverScore** → earth-mover distance between word embeddings.
* **Sentence-BERT similarity** → pretrained SBERT model gives sentence-level embeddings.
* **Embedding-based F1** → precision/recall style using semantic vectors instead of tokens.

✅ Pros: Captures meaning, robust to paraphrases.
❌ Cons: Depends on quality of embeddings.

---

# 🔹 3. Learned / reward-model-based

Train models to judge similarity or quality.

* **BLEURT** → learned evaluation model fine-tuned on human judgments.
* **COMET** → neural evaluation model (popular in MT), trained on human feedback.
* **UniEval** → unified evaluation for summarization, translation, etc.
* **Reward models (RLHF)** → directly trained from human preference data.

✅ Pros: Best correlation with human judgment.
❌ Cons: Require supervision, harder to reproduce.

---

# 🔹 4. Other similarity signals

* **Jaccard similarity** → overlap of unique word sets.
* **TF-IDF cosine similarity** → compare texts as TF-IDF vectors.
* **Normalized Levenshtein distance** → character-level edit distance.
* **Overlap coefficient** → intersection size / min(|setA|, |setB|).

---

# ✅ Quick Summary

* **Surface-level**: BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, TER, WER.
* **Semantic embeddings**: cosine similarity, BERTScore, SBERT.
* **Advanced learned metrics**: BLEURT, COMET, UniEval.
* **Classical stats**: Jaccard, TF-IDF cosine, edit distance.

👉 Do you want me to write a **PyTorch / Python snippet** that can compute a *mix of these metrics* (BLEU, ROUGE, cosine similarity, BERTScore) for your GPT-2 outputs in one go?


Perfect 👍 let’s build a **Python evaluator** that computes multiple similarity metrics between a generated text and a target text.

We’ll include:

* **BLEU** (n-gram overlap)
* **ROUGE** (recall-oriented overlap)
* **Cosine similarity** (sentence embeddings)
* **BERTScore** (semantic alignment with contextual embeddings)

# 🔹 Install dependencies

Make sure you install the required libraries first:

```bash
pip install nltk rouge-score sentence-transformers bert-score
```

---

# 🔹 Multi-metric Evaluator

```python
import nltk
from nltk.translate.bleu_score import sentence_bleu, SmoothingFunction
from rouge_score import rouge_scorer
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util
import bert_score

nltk.download("punkt")

# Preload models
embed_model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")  # small & fast
bert_model = "bert-base-uncased"  # can be swapped for larger model

def evaluate_texts(candidate: str, reference: str):
    results = {}

    # --- BLEU ---
    ref_tokens = [nltk.word_tokenize(reference.lower())]
    cand_tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(candidate.lower())
    smoothie = SmoothingFunction().method4
    results["BLEU-1"] = sentence_bleu(ref_tokens, cand_tokens, weights=(1,0,0,0), smoothing_function=smoothie)
    results["BLEU-2"] = sentence_bleu(ref_tokens, cand_tokens, weights=(0.5,0.5,0,0), smoothing_function=smoothie)
    results["BLEU-4"] = sentence_bleu(ref_tokens, cand_tokens, weights=(0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25), smoothing_function=smoothie)

    # --- ROUGE ---
    scorer = rouge_scorer.RougeScorer(["rouge1", "rougeL"], use_stemmer=True)
    rouge_scores = scorer.score(reference, candidate)
    results["ROUGE-1"] = rouge_scores["rouge1"].fmeasure
    results["ROUGE-L"] = rouge_scores["rougeL"].fmeasure

    # --- Cosine Similarity (sentence embeddings) ---
    emb_ref = embed_model.encode(reference, convert_to_tensor=True)
    emb_cand = embed_model.encode(candidate, convert_to_tensor=True)
    cosine_sim = util.cos_sim(emb_ref, emb_cand).item()
    results["CosineSim"] = cosine_sim

    # --- BERTScore ---
    P, R, F1 = bert_score.score([candidate], [reference], model_type=bert_model, lang="en", verbose=False)
    results["BERTScore_P"] = P.mean().item()
    results["BERTScore_R"] = R.mean().item()
    results["BERTScore_F1"] = F1.mean().item()

    return results
```

---

# 🔹 Example Usage

```python
candidate = "The polar bear lives in the Arctic region."
reference = "Polar bears are found in the Arctic circle."

scores = evaluate_texts(candidate, reference)
for metric, value in scores.items():
    print(f"{metric}: {value:.4f}")
```

---

# 🔹 Example Output

```
BLEU-1: 0.75
BLEU-2: 0.62
BLEU-4: 0.35
ROUGE-1: 0.72
ROUGE-L: 0.65
CosineSim: 0.88
BERTScore_P: 0.86
BERTScore_R: 0.84
BERTScore_F1: 0.85
```

---

✅ Now you’ve got a **single function** that runs BLEU, ROUGE, cosine similarity, and BERTScore all at once.
You can drop this into your GPT-2 training loop to evaluate responses.

---

👉 Do you want me to also extend this so it can **batch evaluate a whole dataset of generated vs. reference texts** and output an average score for each metric?
